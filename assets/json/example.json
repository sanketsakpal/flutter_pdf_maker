Drink a glass of water as soon as you wakeup</strong><br>Some people only drink milk or coffee in the morning, but adding at least one glass of water will help to increase your hydration in the morning. You can keep a water bottle beside your bed if that makes it easier to remember to drink it. Drinking water right after you wake up, will help jumpstart your metabolism as well as rehydrate you after going all night without any liquids.",
                  "<strong>2. Drink water before you get thirsty</strong><br>When you are thirsty, your body signals that it already has a lack of fluid. To stay hydrated, you should drink water often enough to keep this from happening. As you age, your thirst receptors will become less effective at sensing your body's need for hydration, so it is a good idea to get into the habit of sipping water throughout the day. You need to drink at least 8-13 glasses (2-3 liters) of water daily.",
                  "<strong>3. Keep a water bottle with you all day</strong><br>If you work in an office, keep a bottle on your desk and sip from it throughout the day. Set reminders on your computer or smartphone if you have trouble remembering. If your work includes a more physical job, try to find a spot to keep a water bottle where you can access it regularly or just carry it with you. ",
                  "<strong>4. Avoid some fluids</strong><br>When you’re dehydrated, avoid caffeine and alcohol. These have dehydrating effects on the body. Beverages such as coffee, caffeinated tea, and soda should not be taken while dehydrated. You should also avoid fruit juices, as the sugar can have a dehydrating effect by increasing urination.",
                  "<strong>5. Eat foods with a high water content</strong><br>If you are not nauseated, try eating some fruits and vegetables with a high water content. Fruits like watermelon, grapefruit, oranges, and strawberries are very high in water content. Vegetables like broccoli, cauliflower, cabbage, celery, cucumbers, eggplant, lettuce, sweet peppers, radishes, spinach, zucchini, and tomatoes also have very high water content.",
                  "<strong>6. Drink extra water after exercising</strong><br>An additional 1-2  glasses of water is sufficient following moderate exercise, but intense exercise with excessive sweating may require a sports drink, such as Gatorade or Powerade. These beverages contain sodium, electrolytes, and carbohydrates, which will help replace what you lost through sweat.",
                  "<strong>7. Monitor your urine as a sign of your hydration status</strong><br>In addition to drinking before you get thirsty, you should also check your urine as an indication of whether you are staying hydrated enough. People who are consuming adequate fluids will have plenty of clear, light yellow urine. On the other hand, those who are dehydrated will have less urine that is a darker yellow as it is more concentrated."
